              Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827)

               The German composer and pianist Ludwig van Beethoven is widely regarded as the greatest composer who ever lived.  He expanded the Classical traditions of Joseph Haydn, one of his teachers, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and experimented with personal expression,    a characteristic that influenced the Romantic composers who succeeded him. His life and career were marked by progressive deafness, yet the malady did not prevent him from composing some of his most important works during the last 10 years of his life when he was nearly unable to hear. Widening the scope of sonata, symphony, concerto, and quartet, 
            Beethoven’s notable works include Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, Op. 125, Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, Op. 67, Moonlight Sonata, and Für Elise.<em class="apa-reference"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/list/10-classical-music-composers-to-know" target="_blank">Source</a></em>
